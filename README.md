# TransHyperNetR
Implementing TransHyperNetR architecture by replacing Residual Transformer (RT) blocks in TransNetR architecture with Hyper-convolutional ones. This implemnetation is heavily based on two main articles: 
1) [TransNetR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07428)
2) [Hyper-covolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10559)

Thanks to the authors of both articles that have publicly provided their source code!
